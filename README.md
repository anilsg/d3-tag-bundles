# d3-tag-bundles

Use D3 to create hierarchical text content to display tag bundle structure loaded from a CSV file.

[D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) is a JavaScript library targeted at simplifying the creation of SVG visualisations of live data.

This HTML page uses D3 to construct a DOM to present hierarchical text content instead.

I probably should have used the `key()` function or the `d3-hierarchy` module, but this was my first attempt.
