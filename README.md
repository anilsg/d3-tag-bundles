# d3-tag-bundles

Experiment with D3 creating hierarchical text content to display tag bundle structure.

D3 is a JavaScript library targeted at simplifying the creation of SVG visualisations of live data.

This experiment uses D3 to construct a DOM to present hierarchical text content instead.

I probably should have used the `key()` function or the `d3-hierarchy` module, but this was my first attempt.
