Example using D3 to create hierarchical text content to display tag bundle structure loaded from a CSV file.

[D3](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) is a JavaScript library targeted at simplifying the creation of SVG visualisations of live data.

This HTML page uses D3 to construct DOM elements to present hierarchical text content.
